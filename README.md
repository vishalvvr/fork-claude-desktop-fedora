***THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL BUILD SCRIPT!***
This repo is fork of https://github.com/bsneed/claude-desktop-fedora.
I have just rearranged things as per my requirement.

### Setup
unofficial copr build:

```bash
$ dnf copr enable vishalvvr/claude-dektop 
$ dnf install claude-desktop
```

> Note
If you get any electron error, please try to reinstall electron package
$ npm i electron

This is just a tinkering lab.

Happy hacking :)
